    "Logging is a very useful tool in a programmer’s toolbox. It can help you develop a better understanding of the flow of a program and discover scenarios that you might not even have thought of while developing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs provide developers with an extra set of eyes that are constantly looking at the flow that an application is going through. They can store information, like which user or IP accessed the application. If an error occurs, then they can provide more insights than a stack trace by telling you what the state of the program was before it arrived at the line of code where the error occurred.\n",

    "Python provides a logging system as a part of its standard library, so you can quickly add logging to your application. In this article, you will learn why using this module is the best way to add logging to your application as well as how to get started quickly, and you will get an introduction to some of the advanced features available."
